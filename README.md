  ##  Header:

- This Header is consistent across every page of the site.

 - Featured on the left of the header is the Logo for Robert Greens which is also used as an internal navigation link to return to the home page.
 
 - On the right of the header section are three more navigation links with the names: Home, Contact and Gallery. These are internal navigation links that take the user to different pages of the website: the Home page, Contact page and Gallery page respectively.

- The left of this section is a div block with information on opening times for the week and food serving times.

- The right of this section is a div block with some background information and history on the premises.

- I confirmed that this project looks good and is responsive across all screen sizes using "inspect" and applying my page to different devices. 
- I confirmed that all of my text is easily readble throughout my project.
- I have confirmed that all of my social media links work and open in seperate tabs.
- I have confirmed that my Club form works, and requires all information (First name, Last name and Email address.) before it can be submitted.


# Bugs

## Fixed

- When testing I found that the background image I used in my Club page would not load in safari as it was in ".webp" format, once i changed this to ".jpeg" it worked fine.

- When loading the page originally i found that the page was slow to load images, so I resized them and page performance increased significantly.

## Unfixed

- There are no unfixed bugs.
